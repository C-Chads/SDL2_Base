# SDL2_Base

Collection of fully public domain libraries and assets for your programming pleasure.


Packaged especially for authoring programs to use SDL2! I wrote a quick "hello world" and implemented some basic functions.


Of note:
* A physics engine (chadphys.h, chade.h)
* A 6502 emulator (fake6502.h, fake65c02.h)
* the entirety of STB (stb*.c)
* a miniature rasterizing engine (api.h)
* An audio api (api_audio.h)
* A math library (3dMath.h)
* A GUI standard (openimgui.h)
* An audio manipulation library (resweep.h)
* A header file containing the default VGA palette if PCs from the 90s. (vga_pal.h)
* An OBJ file format parser which can parse "VC" color lines (tobjparse.h)
* A multithreading library (lockstepthread.h, tpool.h)
* An 8x8 font (font8x8_basic.h)

I have also included a public domain asset library for easy access.
