Thanks you for downloading the Landscape asset pack v1

These assets were created to aid programmers and game developers and for me to meet new people.

the objects are in OBJ+MTL and Blender format.
The blender files are saved with cycles materials
The OBJ files have their materials info in the mtl with linked textures
